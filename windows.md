Here is the list of services I use on Windows

[TAKtick](https://github.com/Cloud-RF/TAKtick "TAKtick") - a simple open source TAK server made by [cloudRF](https://github.com/Cloud-RF/TAKtick "cloudRF") for windows. Supports only non-encrypted TCP connections and also has a datapackage server. A very simple setup for people who are not familiar with Linux.
