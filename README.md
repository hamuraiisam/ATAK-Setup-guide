A quick reference guide for how I set up my ATAK, services and servers. 

#### Pick an OS

There are multiple options on which OS you can use with ATAK and its servers, I personally use three of them. Each has its benefits and drawbacks.

[Ubuntu 20.4](https://github.com/hamuraiisam/ATAK-Setup-guide/blob/main/Ubuntu.md "Ubuntu 20.4")

[CentOS 7](https://github.com/hamuraiisam/ATAK-Setup-guide/blob/main/centos.md "CentOS 7")

[Windows 10 x64](https://github.com/hamuraiisam/ATAK-Setup-guide/blob/main/windows.md "Windows 10 x64")
